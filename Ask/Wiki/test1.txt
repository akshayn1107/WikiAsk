After I got home, I went to sleep. He created the masterpiece by using a hammer.
Dempsey is a versatile right footed withdrawn forward, normally playing on the left or right for Fulham and the United States, at times shooting from long distances and even scoring at club level from said long range shots. However, he has also proven to be more of a threat the closer to goal he gets. His goals against Egypt and Spain in the Confederations Cup came almost immediately after being moved to forward by a substitution from Bob Bradley. Known for his toughness and resilience, Dempsey played two games for New England Revolution with a broken jaw in 2004 before the team trainer diagnosed it, and upon his return, he played through the pain of a sprained ankle. Despite usually playing in wide positions, he frequently scores close-range goals and has scored repeatedly with diving headers in crowded situations.
His tenacity in midfield combined with his audacious close control dribbling skills frequently results in opponents fouling him, and Dempsey has gained a reputation for fierce play. This has on several occasions lapsed into violent conduct. He was suspended by the New England Revolution for two weeks in March 2006 for a fist fight with teammate Joe Franchino during a practice game and was twice suspended by MLS during the 2006 season for violent conduct against opponents, including an elbow that broke the jaw of national teammate Jimmy Conrad. In a similar incident with Fulham in 2007, Dempsey accidentally broke the cheekbone of Chelsea defender John Terry in an aerial challenge but was not penalized. A further similar incident, in December 2011, took place in a match against Manchester United, with Dempsey accidentally elbowing opponent Phil Jones in the side of the head and causing a suspected broken cheekbone. Again no action was taken by the referee.
In December 2006, English club Fulham offered MLS $4 million for the transfer of Dempsey, then the largest amount ever offered for an MLS player and became another American addition to the Cottagers roster. On January 11, 2007, he was granted a work permit from the Home Office as Fulham announced his signing on a long-term deal. This made Dempsey the most expensive US export to the Premier League in a deal worth a reported Â£2 million. He made his Fulham debut in a 1â€“1 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur on January 20, 2007. His FA Cup debut followed seven days later in a 3â€“0 home win over Stoke City. Dempsey scored his first goal for Fulham on 5 May when he struck the only goal of a 1â€“0 home win over Liverpool. This goal saved Fulham from relegation and effectively guaranteed their place in the top-flight for the following season.
He was one of the most fascinating people on the planet. One of the most fascinating people on the planet, he decided to walk through the medow. A member of the inaugural class of the U.S. Soccer residency program in Bradenton, Florida, Donovan was declared player of the tournament for his role in the United States U17 that finished fourth in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, Donovan later signed with the German side Bayer Leverkusen. After six years with the club, the majority of which was spent on loan at the San Jose Earthquakes, Donovan moved to the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2005, though he returned to the Bundesliga for a three-month spell at the start of 2009 on loan to Bayern Munich. He went on loan again from January to March 2010 with English Premier League side Everton, where he scored twice in ten appearances. Dempsey was born in Nacogdoches, Texas and, for much of his childhood, his family lived in a trailer park, where he and his siblings grew up playing soccer with the local children or anyone they could find. His older brother Ryan was offered a tryout for the Dallas Texans, an elite youth soccer club, and brought Clint, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on the sidelines. Dempsey became a standout on the team at an early age, but had to quit due to his family's time and money constraints as his eldest sister Jennifer was becoming a ranked youth tennis player. Several parents of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club. Akshay was born in a hamper and he ate cheese. Shreepal is never going to understand what is going on, but Akshay probably will. Bo and Bill are not going to finish this tonight, but they will finish it eventually. Bob C.
