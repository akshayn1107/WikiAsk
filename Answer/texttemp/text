Club career





Early career

His parents knew the FC Barcelona youth team coach, Enrique Orizaola, and he persuaded them to consider sending Iniesta to the Barcelona youth academy.Iniesta travelled there with his parents and visited La Masia, the Spanish farmhouse where the team house their young players; the trip convinced them to enroll Iniesta in the Barcelona youth ranks.Iniesta says he "cried rivers" the day he left for La Masia and struggled being separated from his parents; he was very shy and kept to himself while there.

He captained the Barcelona Under-15 team to victory in the Nike Premier Cup of 1999, scoring the winning goal in the last minute of the final, and being named player of the tournament.






He scored twice as Barcelona won La Liga.His contribution to the team was praised by manager Frank Rijkaard as Barcelona won a league and Champions League double.



He played for the first time as a left wing-forward for Barcelona in two Champions League matches against Levski Sofia, finding the net twice.In the first knock out stage of the same competition, he played at central midfield against Liverpool.
With the departure of Ludovic Giuly over the summer break, Iniesta was able to switch his number 24 shirt for his preferred number 8.And my wishes are above everything else.
He also placed 9th in the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year voting, gaining 37 total points.Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Xavi also featured in the top ten.








In September 2008, after the departure of former vice-captain Ronaldinho to Milan, the Barcelona squad decided on its new team captains.In mid-November 2008, Iniesta suffered a leg injury and was expected to return to action in six weeks.Iniesta, however, did not want to come back until he was 100 percent and finally returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a 65th minute substitute against RCD Mallorca.After only 10 minutes he scored a crucial goal and completed a Barcelona comeback in front of the Camp Nou.
On 5 February, Iniesta made his 250th appearance for Barcelona in the Copa del Rey match against Mallorca.
Former teammate Samuel Eto'o described Iniesta as being "the best player in the world; whenever Iniesta is on the pitch, he creates a spectacle."

In his diary of the season, Un Any Al Paradis, he wrote "I connected with that shot with the outside, not the inside or the tip of my boot, but right from my heart, with all my might."



This goal sent Barcelona through to the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome against defending champions Manchester United.Prior to the final, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said: "I'm not obsessed with Messi, Iniesta is the danger.He's fantastic.He makes the team work.The way he finds passes, his movement and ability to create space is incredible.He's so important for Barcelona.After the game, Wayne Rooney described Iniesta as the best player in the world.







Proud of the nomination, he commented that "the fans of the team who have always been there to support our team-mates also deserve to be recognised".Iniesta placed fifth with 134 votes.He missed pre-season fitness training due to the thigh tear suffered in the 2009 Champions League final and this meant that despite featuring in almost as many matches as the previous season, he did so mostly as a substitute, starting only 20 games throughout.Nevetheless, Barcelona once again won the La Liga title securing a record 99 points.His season came to an end after he aggravated a previous calf injury during training.







After being given extended rest by Spain coach Vicente del Bosque following the World Cup, Iniesta returned to Barcelona for a pre-season medical on 9 August 2010.Speaking to FC Barcelona's website, he said of the message dedicated to Daniel Jarque revealed during his goal celebration in the World Cup final: "I did it because I felt it deeply.It showed that what is more important than rivalry, your team or your colours is to be human and a good person.I am delighted because it was the most important moment in my career."



Iniesta scored his first goal of the season for Barcelona during the opening La Liga fixture against Racing Santander, lobbing the ball into the net from a distance of 30 yards.He also had a standing ovation in the home pitch of RCD Espanyol in El Derbi, with the crowd acknowledging his friendship with Daniel Jarque.
He was one of the three finalists for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or, alongside Barcelona teammates Xavi and Messi, but came second as Messi won the award.







On 19 October, Iniesta scored one of the best goals in the Uefa Champions League group stage after a good interchange of passes with Lionel Messi.


After a long goal drought of goals in the Champions League, he scored a vital goal against AC Milan in the quarter final.






Four days later, he was named on a three-man shortlist for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, along with Cristiano Ronaldo and team-mate Lionel Messi.





International career



Iniesta burst on to the international scene in 2001, helping Spain win the UEFA European Under-16 Championship, and was in the squad that claimed the UEFA European Under-19 Championship the following year.Since then, he became a regular choice for the then youth coach Juan Santisteban.In 2003 he formed part of the Spanish side that reached the FIFA World Youth Championship final in the United Arab Emirates, and was named in the FIFA all-star team.During his spell with the Spain U21s side, Iniesta was named captain on several occasions.

Originally a fringe player, he was called up to represent Spain at the World Cup 2006 on 15 May 2006, much to the surprise of many.Iniesta won his first cap for Spain when he was brought on at half-time in a friendly against Russia on 27 May 2006.

He scored his first goal for Spain in a friendly against England on 7 February 2007.His long range effort, hitting the underside of the crossbar on the way in, gave Spain the lead on 63 minutes.Iniesta proceeded to play a pivotal part in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008 by scoring goals against the likes of Sweden and by assisting the strikers.Iniesta usually played in the middle of the pitch, but he was also trusted with roles further up the pitch when Spain was away from home, most notably in the game against Denmark where he was given an advanced left wing position.

Iniesta was selected in Spain's squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.Though a stomach virus somewhat hampered his performances in the group stages, he still played an integral part in the midfield.He played in the first two of Spain's group stage matches and proved an important part of the team providing a particularly notable pass for David Villa's second goal against Russia.Iniesta was substituted before the penalty shoot out itself.In the semi-final against Russia he played the entire 90 minutes and produced a quality cross which Xavi converted to open the scoring.The Technical Study Group named him the Man of the Match.Iniesta was named in the Team of the Tournament alongside fellow Spain midfielders Xavi and Marcos Senna and 6 other teammates.

Iniesta did not participate in the 2009 Confederations Cup in South Africa due to a thigh muscle injury.Spain was eliminated from the Tournament.



He was also named man of the match.For his excellent performances in helping Spain reach the final of the tournament, Iniesta was shortlisted for the Golden Ball award.He won the man of the match award for his performance which sent Spain to their first ever World Cup win.

Europa Press reported that Iniesta was the most popular Spanish sportsman on the internet throughout 2010.The study performed by company Vipnet360 examined the web presence on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Iniesta was followed by Iker Casillas, David Villa, Rafael Nadal, and Fernando Alonso rounding the top 5.

In the UEFA Euro 2012, Iniesta was awarded the man of the match award for his performances in three different matches.By winning the award, Iniesta became the only Spanish player to win the award at least once in each of Spain's three consecutive successful tournaments.Iniesta was also chosen as the UEFA Euro 2012 Player of the Tournament.





Style of play



Beyond his raw talent that was spotted at a young age by FC Barcelona's scouts, it was his great versatility, work ethic and inventiveness that allowed him to stake a claim on a first-team place at the age of 18.Vicente del Bosque described him as "the complete footballer.He can attack and defend, he creates and scores," and Frank Rijkaard said "I played him as a false winger, central midfielder, deep midfielder and just behind the striker and he was always excellent." He was used initially as a wide-forward in the absence of Juan Roman Riquelme and Ronaldinho by Louis van Gaal and Rijkaard respectively, but made his name as a world-class player in central midfield alongside or in lieu of Xavi, at both club and international level.As FIFA.com says, "It is in this position that his direct style and quick feet can be used to full effect, with the ball seeming glued to his toes as he races into threatening positions.Iniesta is a player known for his passing, dribbling, vision and movement.Iniesta has been praised for his understanding and interplay with Xavi; former Barcelona teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst saying "They have a special relationship, they always have, they just seem to know where the other one is".
Zidane also praised Iniesta by saying "Iniesta is really impressing me," the 39-year-old told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope."He's got so much influence in Spain's game.He reminds me of myself, but he is more pale than me." Chelsea striker and Spain team-mate Fernando Torres said that "we've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly." He is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders ever to play for Barcelona.





Personal life

Since 2008, Iniesta has dated Anna Ortiz, and in September 2010 he confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.On 3 April 2011 she gave birth to their daughter Valeria.The couple married on 8 July 2012.
