German language






Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.A number of words are derived from Latin and Greek, and fewer from French and English.

German is written using the Latin alphabet.




History





Origins



The history of the language begins with the High German consonant shift during the migration period, separating Old High German dialects from Old Saxon.The earliest evidence of Old High German is from scattered Elder Futhark inscriptions, especially in Alemannic, from the 6th century AD; the earliest glosses (Abrogans) date to the 8th; and the oldest coherent texts (the Hildebrandslied, the Muspilli and the Merseburg Incantations) to the 9th century.Old Saxon at this time belongs to the North Sea Germanic cultural sphere, and Low Saxon was to fall under German rather than Anglo-Frisian influence during the Holy Roman Empire.

As Germany was divided into many different states, the only force working for a unification or standardization of German for several hundred years was the general wish of writers to be understood by as many readers as possible.





Modern German





In Germany

This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany, which had already at that time begun to lose the genitive case and the preterite tense).Initially, copies of the Bible had a long list of glosses for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect.It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a widely accepted standard, thus ending the period of Early New High German.



Until about 1800, standard German was mainly a written language: in urban northern Germany, the local dialects of Low Saxon or Low German were spoken; Standard German, which was markedly different, was often learned as a foreign language with uncertain pronunciation.Prescriptive pronunciation guides considered northern German pronunciation as the standard.However, the actual pronunciation of Standard German varies from region to region.





In the Austrian empire

German was the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe.Until the mid-19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire.Its use indicated that the speaker was a merchant, an urbanite, irrespective of nationality.Some cities, such as Prague (German: Prag) and Budapest (Buda, German: Ofen), were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain.Others, such as Pozsony (German: Pressburg, now Bratislava), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time.A few cities remained mainly non-German.However most cities, such as Prague, Budapest, Bratislava, Zagreb (German: Agram), and Ljubljana (German: Laibach), were primarily German during this time, although surrounded by territory where other languages were spoken.





Switzerland

In Switzerland, a number of local dialects are spoken in the German-speaking cantons, but standard German is used as a written language.





Standardisation


Media and written works are now almost all produced in Standard German (often called Hochdeutsch ("high German")) which is understood in all areas where German is spoken.

The first dictionary of the Brothers Grimm, the 16 parts of which were issued between 1852 and 1860, remains the most comprehensive guide to the vocabulary of the German language.In 1860, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the Duden Handbook.In 1901, this was declared the standard definition of the German language.Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until 1998, when a controversial spelling reform was officially promulgated by governments of all German-speaking countries.





Geographic distribution



In Namibia, German Namibians retain German educational institutions.

According to Global Reach (2004), 6.9% of the Internet population is German.According to Netz-tipp (2002), 7.7% of webpages are written in German, making it second only to English in the European language group.They also report that 12% of Google's users use its German interface.





Europe



German is primarily spoken in Germany (where it is the first language for more than 95% of the population), Austria (89%), Switzerland (65%), the majority of Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein - the latter being the only state with German as the sole official and spoken language.

Other European German-speaking communities are found in Northern Italy (in South Tyrol and in some municipalities in other provinces), in the East Cantons of Belgium, in the French regions of Alsace and Lorraine, and in some border villages of the former South Jutland County of Denmark.

German-speaking communities can also be found in parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Russia and Kazakhstan.Forced expulsions after World War II and massive emigration to Germany in the 1980s and 1990s have depopulated most of these communities.





South America

There are also important concentrations of German-speaking descendants in Argentina, Paraguay, Venezuela, Bolivia and Chile.The elder people of Pozuzo, in Peru (the only Austrian-German colony in the world) still communicate in their traditional Austrian, upper Inn valley dialect.In the 20th century, over 100,000 German political refugees and invited entrepreneurs settled in Latin America, in countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, and the Dominican Republic, to establish German-speaking enclaves, and reportedly there is a small German immigration to Puerto Rico.Nearly all inhabitants of the city of Pomerode, a municipality where this language is co-oficial in the state of Santa Catarina in Brazil, can speak German.

In most locations where German immigrants settled, the vast majority of their descendents no longer speak German, as they have been largely assimilated into the host language and culture of the specific location of settlement; generally English in North America, and Spanish or Portuguese in Latin America.However, some cities in Brazil have the German language or Pomeranian language as co-oficial.They are:

North America



In the United States, the states of North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states where German is the most common language spoken at home after English (the second most spoken language in other states is either Spanish or French).An indication of the German presence can be found in the names of such places as New Ulm and many other towns in Minnesota; Bismarck (state capital), Munich, Karlsruhe, and Strasburg in North Dakota; New Braunfels,Fredericksburg, and Muenster in Texas; and Kiel, Berlin and Germantown in Wisconsin.

Between 1843 and 1910, more than 5 million Germans emigrated overseas, mostly to the United States.German remained an important medium for churches, schools, newspapers, and even the administration of the United States Brewers' Association through the early 20th century, but was severely repressed during World War I.Over the course of the 20th century many of the descendants of 18th century and 19th century immigrants ceased speaking German at home, but small populations of elderly (as well as some younger) speakers can be found in Pennsylvania (Amish, Hutterites, Dunkards and some Mennonites historically spoke Hutterite German and a West Central German variety of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch), Kansas (Mennonites and Volga Germans), North Dakota (Hutterite Germans, Mennonites, Russian Germans, Volga Germans, and Baltic Germans), South Dakota, Montana, Texas (Texas German), Wisconsin, Indiana, Oregon, Louisiana and Oklahoma.A significant group of German Pietists in Iowa formed the Amana Colonies and continue to practice speaking their heritage language.Early twentieth century immigration was often to St. Louis, Chicago, New York, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.



In Canada, there are 622,650 speakers of German according to the most recent census in 2006, while people of German ancestry (German Canadians) are found throughout the country.German-speaking communities are particularly found in British Columbia (118,035) and Ontario (230,330).There is a large and vibrant community in the city of Kitchener, Ontario, which was at one point named Berlin.German immigrants were instrumental in the country's three largest urban areas: Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver; while post-Second World War immigrants managed to preserve a fluency in the German language in their respective neighborhoods and sections.
German ancestry is also said to be found in neighboring towns around Guadalajara, Jalisco and much of Northern Mexico, where German influence was immersed into the Mexican culture.
The dialects of German which are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German-speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from.For example, Pennsylvania German resembles Palatinate German dialects, and Hutterite German resembles dialects of Carinthia.Texas German is a dialect spoken in the areas of Texas settled by the Adelsverein, such as New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.In the Amana Colonies in the state of Iowa, Amana German is spoken.Plautdietsch is a large minority language spoken in Northern Mexico by the Mennonite communities, and is spoken by more than 200,000 people in Mexico.Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German spoken by the Amish population of Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio.

Hutterite German is an Upper German dialect of the Austro-Bavarian variety of the German language, which is spoken by Hutterite communities in Canada and the United States.Hutterite is spoken in the U.S. states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.Its speakers belong to some Schmiedleit, Lehrerleit, and Dariusleit Hutterite groups, but there are also speakers among the older generations of Prairieleit (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies).Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn to speak Hutterite German before learning English, the standard language of the surrounding areas, in school.Many of these children, though, continue with German Grammar School, in addition to public school, throughout a student's elementary education.[citation needed]





Africa



German is spoken by about 25-30,000 people as a mother tongue in the former German colony of Namibia.Though it no longer enjoys status as an official language, it is used in a wide variety of spheres, especially business and tourism, as well as churches (most notably the German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK)), schools (e.g.artist EES).

There is also some German medium education in Rwanda.

There are a number of communities where German is spoken in South Africa, especially in and around Wartburg.





Australia

In Australia, the state of South Australia experienced a pronounced wave of immigration in the 1840s from Prussia (particularly the Silesia region).With the prolonged isolation from other German speakers and contact with Australian English some have suggested a unique dialect formed known as Barossa German spoken predominantly in the Barossa Valley near Adelaide.Usage sharply declined with the advent of World War I, due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment in the population and related government action.It continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century but now its use is limited to a few older speakers.[citation needed]





New Zealand

German migration to New Zealand in the 19th century was less pronounced than migration from Britain, Ireland, and perhaps even Scandinavia.Despite this there were significant pockets of German speaking communities which lasted until the first decades of the 20th century.German-speakers settled principally in Puhoi, Nelson, and Gore.Puhoi was settled by Bohemians, and these settlers retained the Egerlaender dialect long after it had died out in its native land.It is estimated that a few dozen inhabitants still speak this dialect fluently.

At the last census (2006), 37,500 people in New Zealand spoke German.This made German the third most spoken European language after English and French and overall the ninth most spoken language.German is something of an invisible minority language, however, as most speakers, other than the very young, are fluent in English.Unlike some less widely spoken languages (for example Korean, Niuean, and Cook Island Maori), government departments make no provision for communication with German speakers in their language.





Asia

There is also an important German creole being studied and recovered, named Unserdeutsch, spoken in the former German colony of Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia and in northern Australia (i.e.coastal parts of Queensland and Western Australia), by a few elderly people.The risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars.A few Indonesian elderly may also speak German.





Standard German



Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region, but as a written language.However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by standard German; this is the case in large stretches of Northern Germany, but also in major cities in other parts of the country.

Standard German differs regionally, between German-speaking countries, in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation, and even grammar and orthography.This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects.Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct.German is thus considered a pluricentric language.

In most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to circumstances.

In the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of standard German is largely restricted to the written language.This situation has been called a medial diglossia.Swiss Standard German is used in the Swiss, Austrian Standard German officially in the Austrian education system.





Official status

Standard German is the only official language in Liechtenstein; it shares official status in Germany (with Danish, Frisian, Romany and Sorbian as minority languages), in Austria (with Slovene, Croatian, and Hungarian as minority languages), Switzerland (with French, Italian and Romansh), Belgium (with Dutch (Flemish) and French) and Luxembourg (with French and Luxembourgish).It is an official regional language in Italy (South Tyrol), as well as in the cities of Sopron (Hungary), Krahule (Slovakia) and several cities in Romania.It is the official language of command (together with Italian) of the Vatican Swiss Guard.

German has an officially recognized status as a regional or auxiliary language in Denmark (Southern Jutland region), Italy (Gressoney valley)[citation needed], Namibia, Poland (Opole region), and Russia[citation needed] (Asowo and Halbstadt).

German is one of the 23 official languages of the European Union and one of the three working languages.It is the language with the largest number of native speakers in the European Union, and is the second-most spoken language in Europe, just behind English and ahead of French.





German as a foreign language



German is the third most taught foreign language in the English-speaking world, after French and Spanish.

It is therefore the most spoken first language in the EU.It is the second most known foreign language in the EU.It is one of the official languages of the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission, along with English and French.Among citizens of the EU-15 countries[clarification needed], 32% say they can converse in German (either as a mother tongue or as a second or foreign language).This is assisted by the widespread availability of German TV by cable or satellite.





Dialects



German is a member of the western branch of the Germanic family of languages, which in turn is part of the Indo-European language family.The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into High German and Low German, also called Low Saxon.Yet, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language.Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level, even by many native speakers.The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.

The variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible.Some dialects are not intelligible to people who only know standard German.However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon languages.





Low German



Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League.It was the predominant language in Northern Germany.This changed in the 16th century: in 1534 the Luther Bible was published.This translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the Early New High German.It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on Central and Upper German varieties.The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low German and became the language of science and literature.Around the same time, the Hanseatic league, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established, while the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.

The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education in Standard German in schools.Gradually Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated.Today Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable standard German influx[clarification needed] and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as Missingsch.Sometimes, Low Saxon and Low Franconian varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift.However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since World War II.





High German



High German is divided into Central German, High Franconian (a transitional dialect), and Upper German.It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and parts of Germany roughly between the River Main and the southern edge of the Lowlands.Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German, although the common (but not linguistically correct) German term for modern Standard German is Hochdeutsch, that is, High German.

The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in Luxembourg have been officially standardised and institutionalised and are usually considered a separate language known as Luxembourgish.

The two High Franconian dialects are East Franconian and South Franconian.

Upper German dialects include Northern Austro-Bavarian, Central Austro-Bavarian, Southern Austro-Bavarian, Swabian, East Franconian, High Alemannic German, Highest Alemannic German, Alsatian and Low Alemannic German.They are spoken in parts of the Alsace, southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.

The High German varieties spoken by Ashkenazi Jews (mostly in the former Soviet Union) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, Yiddish.It is the only Germanic language that does not use the Latin script as the basis of its standard alphabet.





Varieties of standard German

In German linguistics, German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German.

The German dialects are the traditional local varieties.They are traditionally traced back to the different German tribes[citation needed].Many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, since they often differ from standard German in lexicon, phonology and syntax.If a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the Ethnologue).However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.

The varieties of standard German refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric standard German.They only differ slightly in lexicon and phonology.In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.





Grammar



German is an inflected language with three grammatical genders; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.





Noun inflection

German nouns inflect into:

four cases: nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative.

three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter.Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in ...ung (ing), ...schaft (-ship), ...keit or ...heit (-hood) are feminine, while nouns ending in ...chen or ...lein (diminutive forms) are neuter and nouns ending in ...ismus (-ism) are masculine.Others are controversial, sometimes depending on the region in which it is spoken.Additionally, ambiguous endings exist, such as ...er (-er), e.g.Feier (feminine), celebration, party, Arbeiter (masculine), labourer, and Gewitter (neuter), thunderstorm.

two numbers: singular and plural

This degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old High German and in other old Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek, or Sanskrit, and somewhat less than, for instance, in modern Icelandic and Russian.The three genders have collapsed in the plural, which now behaves, grammatically, somewhat as a fourth gender.With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender/number, but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities.Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative.Both of these cases are losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.The dative ending is considered somewhat old-fashioned in many contexts and often dropped, but it is still used in proverbs and the like, in formal speech and in written language.Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular.Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular.The plural does have an inflection for the dative.In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: -s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e.

") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxemburgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language), although it was historically common in other languages such as Danish and English.

Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in "open" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the "closed" form without spaces, for example: Baumhaus ("tree house").German allows arbitrarily long compounds, as English does to some extent.(See also English compounds.) In German these are quite common.However, examples like this are perceived as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward, and even satiric by native speakers.





Verb inflection



Inflection of standard German verbs includes:

two main conjugation classes: weak and strong (as in English).Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.

three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.

two numbers: singular and plural

three moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive (in addition to infinitive)

two voices: active and passive; the passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is dividable into static and dynamic[clarification needed].

two tenses without auxiliary verbs (present, preterite) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs (perfect, pluperfect, future and future perfect)

the distinction between grammatical aspects is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking: thus the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys second-hand information[clarification needed]; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.

the distinction between perfect and progressive aspect is and has at every stage of development been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, is nowadays rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.

disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (blicken - to look, erblicken - to see [unrelated form: sehen - to see]).

Verb prefixes

The meaning of basic verbs can be expanded, and sometimes radically changed, through the use of a number of prefixes.Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; ver- is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in versuchen (to try), vernehmen (to interrogate), verteilen (to distribute), verstehen (to understand).


Many German verbs have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function.In finite verb forms this is split off and moved to the end of the clause, and is hence considered by some to be a "resultative particle".For example, mitgehen meaning "to go along" would be split, giving Gehen Sie mit?(Literal: "Go you with?").

Indeed, several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement: e.g.


A selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:

He -rived on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home ar-.





Word order

Word order is generally less rigid than in Modern English.There are two common word orders: one is for main clauses and another for subordinate clauses.In normal affirmative sentences the inflected verb always has position 2.In polar questions, exclamations, and wishes it always has position 1.In subordinate clauses the verb is supposed to occur at the very end, but in speech this rule is often disregarded.

German requires that a verbal element (main verb or auxiliary verb) appear second in the sentence.The verb is preceded by the topic of the sentence.The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence.For a sentence without an auxiliary this gives, amongst other options:

Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.(The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)

Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.(The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)

Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.(The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)

Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.(Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)

Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))

The position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object, or another argument.In a declarative sentence in English if the subject does not occur before the predicate the sentence could well be misunderstood.This is not the case in German.

Auxiliary verbs

When an auxiliary verb is present, the auxiliary appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end.This occurs notably in the creation of the perfect.Many word orders are still possible, e.g.:

Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.(The old man has given me the book today.)

Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.(The book has the old man given me today.)

Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.(Today the old man has given me the book.)

Modal verbs

Sentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end.For example, the sentence in Modern English "Should he go home?" would be rearranged in German to say "Should he (to) home go?" (Soll er nach Hause gehen?).Thus in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses the infinitives are clustered at the end.Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following English sentence: "What did you bring that book which I don't like to be read to out of up for?"

Multiple infinitives

German subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end.Given that auxiliaries encode future, passive, modality, and the perfect, this can lead to very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence.In these constructions, the past participle in ge- is often replaced by the infinitive.

Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossenV wordenpsv seinperf solltemod

One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should

("It is suspected that the deserter probably should have been shot")

The order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, though the latter version is unusual.


He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let


He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had

("He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made")





Vocabulary



Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from Latin, Greek, Italian, French and most recently English.

Latin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the Roman Empire and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German.Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g.Pforte, Tafel, Mauer from Latin porta, tabula, murus).Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries.Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during Renaissance humanism.In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last decades often indirectly through borrowings from English.During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music.The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words.The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.

At the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great.[citation needed] Thus, Notker Labeo was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like Joachim Heinrich Campe who introduced hundreds of words that are still used in modern German.Even today, there are movements that try to promote the Ersatz (substitution) of foreign words deemed unnecessary with German alternatives.It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated, and thus democratise public life, too.

As in English, there are many pairs of synonyms due to the enrichment of the Germanic vocabulary with loanwords from Latin and Latinized Greek.These words often have different connotations from their Germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly.





The size of the vocabulary of German is difficult to estimate.The modern German scientific vocabulary is estimated at nine million words and word groups (based on the analysis of 35 million sentences of a corpus in Leipzig, which as of July 2003 included 500 million words in total).





Orthography



German is written in the Latin alphabet.





Present


Some operating systems use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in Microsoft Windows this is done using Alt codes.German readers understand those transcriptions (although they look unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling.(In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g.)

There is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence.Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts.In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial Sch and St are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after S, but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.






Past



These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans serif Antiqua typefaces used today, and particularly the handwritten forms are difficult for the untrained to read.The printed forms however were claimed by some to be actually more readable when used for printing Germanic languages.(Often, foreign names in a text were printed in a "normal" typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The Nazis initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher since they were considered Aryan, although they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.The Fraktur script remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and oldness.

Many Antiqua typefaces include the long s also.A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting.The long s only appears in lower case.





Reform of 1996



The spelling reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute.After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year.In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, while in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old comma rules were again put in force.






Phonology





Vowels



In German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either short or long, as follows:

In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are closed.

Whether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:

If a vowel (other than i) is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g.
If a vowel (other than i) is followed by h or if an i is followed by an e, it is long.

If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g.ff, ss or tt), ck, tz or a consonant cluster (e.g.st or nd), it is nearly always short (e.g.Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a feeding order of gemination and then vowel shortening.

Both of these rules have exceptions (e.g.For an i that is neither in the combination ie (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule.In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany (Hessen), the o in the proper name "Hoffmann" is pronounced long while most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the e in the geographical name "Mecklenburg" for people in that region.'laugh!' (imperative).


In many varieties, an /r/ at the end of a syllable is vocalised.





Consonants

With approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages.The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below.



3 The voiceless stops /p/, /t/, /k/ are aspirated except when preceded by a sibilant, exactly as in English.




Consonant spellings

c standing by itself is not a German letter.The combination ck is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.

Ch never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word.In borrowed words with initial Ch before bright vowels (Chemie "chemistry" etc.Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace them with [k], as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in Charakter, Christentum.

f is pronounced [f] as in "father".

h is pronounced [h] as in "home" at the beginning of a syllable.After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g.Reh = roe deer).

In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.


The digraph qu is pronounced [kv].

In some varieties, the r is pronounced as a "tongue-tip" r (the alveolar trill [r]).
