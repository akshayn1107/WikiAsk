  Annotating file /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr3/pmassey/Public/project/WikiAsk/Answer/texttemp/text WARNING: Parsing of sentence failed, possibly because of out of memory.  Will ignore and continue: two numbers : singular and plural This degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old High German and in other old Indo-European languages such as Latin , Ancient Greek , or Sanskrit , and somewhat less than , for instance , in modern Icelandic and Russian.The three genders have collapsed in the plural , which now behaves , grammatically , somewhat as a fourth gender.With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender/number , but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities.Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative.Both of these cases are losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.The dative ending is considered somewhat old-fashioned in many contexts and often dropped , but it is still used in proverbs and the like , in formal speech and in written language.Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive , dative and accusative in the singular.Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular.The plural does have an inflection for the dative.In total , seven inflectional endings -LRB- not counting plural markers -RRB- exist in German : - s , - es , - n , - ns , - en , - ens , - e. '' -RRB- This convention is almost unique to German today -LRB- shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxemburgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language -RRB- , although it was historically common in other languages such as Danish and English .
